# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Database**: `sql_project_p1`

This project showcases core SQL skills for cleaning, exploring, and analyzing retail sales data. The dataset captures transaction-level details such as customer demographics, product categories, and sales figures. The project is ideal for beginners looking to build a foundational understanding of SQL for business analytics.

## Objectives

1. **Database Setup**: Work within an existing database and inspect the table structure.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Standardize column types and remove null or incomplete records.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Get a general sense of the data via descriptive queries.
4. **Business Analysis**: Extract insights using analytical queries to answer real-world business questions.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Used**: `sql_project_p1`
- **Table**: `retail_sales`

Initial exploration and schema correction:

```sql
USE sql_project_p1;

SELECT * FROM retail_sales;

DESCRIBE retail_sales;

ALTER TABLE retail_sales
MODIFY transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
MODIFY sale_date DATE,
MODIFY sale_time TIME,
MODIFY customer_id INT,
MODIFY gender VARCHAR(15),
MODIFY age INT,
MODIFY category VARCHAR(15),
MODIFY quantiy INT,
MODIFY price_per_unit FLOAT,
MODIFY cogs FLOAT,
MODIFY total_sale FLOAT;
```

---

### 2. Data Cleaning

Records with `NULL` values were removed to ensure consistency:

```sql
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE transactions_id IS NULL 
   OR sale_date IS NULL 
   OR sale_time IS NULL 
   OR customer_id IS NULL 
   OR gender IS NULL 
   OR age IS NULL 
   OR category IS NULL 
   OR quantiy IS NULL 
   OR price_per_unit IS NULL 
   OR cogs IS NULL 
   OR total_sale IS NULL;
```

---

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

Some foundational questions:

- **Total sales transactions**:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_sale FROM retail_sales;
  ```

- **Unique customers**:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers FROM retail_sales;
  ```

- **Categories available**:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category) FROM retail_sales;
  SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;
  ```

### 4. Business Questions & Analysis

**Q1. Sales on 2022-11-05**
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

**Q2. Clothing category, quantity > 4, in Nov 2022**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM retail_sales 
WHERE category = 'Clothing' AND quantiy >= 4 AND DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m') = '2022-11';
```

**Q3. Total sales per category**
```sql
SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS net_sale, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

**Q4. Average age of customers who purchased Beauty products**
```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(age), 2) AS avg_age 
FROM retail_sales 
WHERE category = 'Beauty';
```

**Q5. Transactions with total sale > 1000**
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales 
WHERE total_sale > 1000;
```

**Q6. Transaction count by gender and category**
```sql
SELECT category, gender, COUNT(*) 
FROM retail_sales 
GROUP BY category, gender 
ORDER BY category;
```

**Q7. Best-selling month per year (avg sale)**
```sql
WITH monthly_avg AS (
    SELECT 
        YEAR(sale_date) AS year, 
        MONTH(sale_date) AS month,
        ROUND(AVG(total_sale), 2) AS avg_sale
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY YEAR(sale_date), MONTH(sale_date)
)
SELECT *
FROM monthly_avg
WHERE (year, avg_sale) IN (
    SELECT year, MAX(avg_sale)
    FROM monthly_avg
    GROUP BY year
)
ORDER BY year;
```

**Q8. Top 5 customers by total sales**
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Q9. Unique customers per category**
```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY category;
```

**Q10. Shift-wise order distribution**
```sql
WITH hourly_sale AS (
    SELECT *,
           CASE
               WHEN HOUR(sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
               WHEN HOUR(sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
               ELSE 'Evening'
           END AS shift
    FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT shift, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM hourly_sale
GROUP BY shift;
```
